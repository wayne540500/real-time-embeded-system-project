# “Embedded Sentry”
Objective:

● Use the data collected from a single accelerometer and/or gyro to record a hand 
movement sequence as a means to generally “unlock” a resource.

● Recorded sequence must be saved on the microcontroller, using a “Record Key” 
feature.

● User then must replicate the key sequence within sufficient tolerances to unlock 
the resource.

● A successful unlock must be indicated by a visual indication, such as an LED or 
similar indicator.
